<div id="Objective">
When designing and producing my artworks, I chose to let my imagination and creativity work out my design process to forge my own unique and interesting design in my illustrations. When working on something, I tend to design illustrations based on what interests me or how it relates to the theme that is being represented in the artworks. While designing, I like my work to be as simple as possible when working on the rough drafts before transitioning to include stronger elements in my artworks so that they can have a simplistic and bold statement. I like my artwork to be created for fun and exciting to look at, but I will give a strong expression of my ideas if I need to on certain topics if I want to. I like to make what I want to make and I want to find enjoyment and passion in my artworks that people would find interesting to look at and how I can find satisfaction in the joy they bring to people.

      <td>This unselfie image is the result of my exercise where the objective of the assignment is to change the image of your selfie into a completely different form of image. When working on the image, I mess around with the options that were available to me and selecting random parts of my face to create an interesting and random pattern that ended up creating a glitchy techno theme image. The overall theme was a product of randomness that ended up creating an effective and amazing tech out gitch motif that produced spectacular results and popular reception.</td>
